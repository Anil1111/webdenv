AJAX : Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
It exchanges data with web server
It updates a web page without reloading the page



AJAX uses a combination of:
 A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
 JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)



For security reasons, modern browsers do not allow access across domains.
A resource makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource from a different domain, 
or port than the one which the first resource itself serves.
Example
The browser sends the OPTIONS request with an Origin HTTP header.
The value of this header is the domain that served the parent page. 
When a page from http://www.example.com attempts to access a user's data in service.example.com, the request header would be sent to service.example.com 
as                                          Origin : http://www.example.com

The server at service.example.com may respond with:
An Access-Control-Allow-Origin (ACAO) header in its response indicating which origin sites are allowed.
as                                          Access-Control-Allow-Origin : http://www.example.com

An error page if the server does not allow the cross-origin request

An Access-Control-Allow-Origin (ACAO) header with a wildcard that allows all domains:
as                                          Access-Control-Allow-Origin : *



The onreadystatechange event is triggered four times (1-4), one time for each change in the readyState.
0: request not initialized
1: server connection established
2: request received
3: processing request
4: request finished and response is ready
