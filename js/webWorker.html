# A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.
# When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
# A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page.
# You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.
