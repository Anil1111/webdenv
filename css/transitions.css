/* A transition is an animation, just one that is performed between two distinct states - i.e. a start state and an end state.
   Animation does not specifically involve a start state and an end state, 
   or if you need more fine grain control over the keyframes in a transition, then you've got to use an animation.

   1. the CSS property you want to add an effect to
   2. the duration of the effect 

   The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (eg:- width) changes value
